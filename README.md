# Data-Encryption-Tool-with-dynamic-and-secure-key-management-using-graph

Abstract

Cloud-based data encryption is a growing field of research, as more and more data are being stored and processed in the cloud. However, cloud-based data encryption also introduces new security challenges, such as key management. In this paper, we present a cloud-based data encryption tool with dynamic and secure key management. The system uses both symmetric and asymmetric keys to encrypt data and manage the ownership of the keys. With the dynamic approach implemented into the system, users will have a dynamic and secure data encryption and key management tool. The graph model is proposed to manage the data and key within the system. Finally, the performance of the system is evaluated.
